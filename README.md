# neighborhood-change-index-pt1
Python-based tools for ArcGIS to automate the analysis of neighborhood change or other phenomena over time.

This toolkit was inspired by a method of analysis described in Alan Mallach’s 2008 report Managing Neighborhood Change: A Framework for Sustainable and Equitable Revitalization. Outputs of this toolkit could be used to formulate strategies for “sustainable and equitable revitalization” based on which state of change each tract is currently experiencing. While this toolkit was developed with neighborhood change analysis in mind, it is very flexible and can be used for other purposes. The user is able to choose how many variables will make up the index and at what geographic level they are aggregated, if some of those variables should detract from the raw score, whether the index should be calculated using the quantile or equal interval classification method, and how many index categories there should be.
